# Captcha Riddler

Simple but effective spam protection.

This module lets you create custom riddles for the Captcha module,
requiring guests to answer the 'riddle' before being allowed to submit the form.

- Create your own Captcha questions to give your forms personality that matches your site
- Allows multiple possible answers for one question.
- Multiple possible questions, randomly presenting just one to the user.

## Examples

Depending on your situation, you might ask different questions to get the
most out of Captcha Riddler without frustating your site visitors.

If people who register or fill out any forms should know certain things anyway, ask
these commonly known things, e.g.:

**Q:** What's the name of our club mascot?

If your site has a language with accents or umlauts, make sure that answers
contain these, e.g.:

**Q:** Bekannte deutsche Stadt mit Dom - K...

**A:** KÃ¶ln

Or create simple groups of words where one doesn't belong, e.g.:

**Q:** Which word does not belong: cat, dog, cow, bicycle

Make sure you create a bunch of questions - the more the better.
